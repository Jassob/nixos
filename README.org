* Set up

  1. Clone repository to /etc/nixos/
  1. Uncomment one of the machine-specific configurations at the top in =configuration.nix=
  1. Add a password to the user in =user-configuration.nix=
  1. Run ~nixos-rebuild switch~ to build a new bootable instance of this configuration.


* TODO Check out ~programs.*~ in configuration.nix

  =configuration.nix= can set a lot of program settings, for instance
  global settings for ZSH or Bash that should be set for all
  users. This way we can set these options declaratively instead of relying
  on config files.
