# My NixOS configuration

This is my NixOS configuration. It is kept as up-to-date as reasonable
and I constantly change various things as I discover new things that I
need or how my tools work, expect a more or less constant flux.

The user configuration is managed through home-manager, allowing me to
make most of the configuration declarative.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to /etc/nixos
1. Run `nixos-rebuild switch`
